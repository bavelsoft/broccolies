magical regression testing - show differing fields, documentation
support for references for static data
better mechanism to clear references, or at least last one
generate interfaces?
collections
field references - as argument to expecter, make it a weakmap
inherit reference= param
invariants? like fields which must never be empty
all the messages that match x must also match y, useful for parameterized scenarios
