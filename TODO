better mechanism to clear references, or at least last one
filter out fields from generated equals method
test regression, using 
    @Rule public TestName testName = new TestName();

    @Before
    public void before() {
        RegressionUtil.startTest(testName.getMethodName());
    }
generate interfaces
collections
field references - as argument to expecter, make it a weakmap
regression - allow running twice to find the fields that change
inherit reference= param
invariants? like fields which must never be empty
all the messages that match x must also match y, useful for parameterized scenarios
